## C

Inspired by [BOBUK](https://github.com/bobuk/c)


#### Changes
* windows compatibility removed (sorry windows folks)
* commands are simplified (only prefixed by '+' are supported)
* '-2' key is removed and persistent commands added instead (+C, +V, +DEL): upper case means that buffer is cleared
* some minor changes (do not show progress per each file, show total summary instead, overwrite choices, etc)

#### How to use
* copy to bin directory and create symlinks for each command

#### TODO
* BUG: does not overwrite existing directories
